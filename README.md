# mtolives-book-now
The mtolives-book-now widget is a lightweight, self-hosted Web Component (Custom Element + Shadow DOM) that renders a two-field date-range picker (Check-in / Check-out) and a BOOK NOW button. It navigates to the Cloudbeds booking engine with the selected dates passed as query parameters.
